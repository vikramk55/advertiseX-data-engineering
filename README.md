## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Welcome to the AdvertiseX Data Engineering Case Study project documentation. This documentation provides detailed information on setting up, using, and contributing to the project.

## 2. Project Purpose <a name="project-purpose"></a>

The purpose of this project is to address the data processing challenges faced by AdvertiseX, a digital advertising technology company specializing in programmatic advertising. The solution includes scalable data ingestion, data processing, storage, and monitoring components to handle various data formats and sources.

## 3. System Requirements <a name="system-requirements"></a>

### Prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package installer)
- Prometheus
- Alertmanager
 
In the requirements.txt file, you should include the Python packages that your project depends on. These packages are typically installed using pip and are necessary for running your project. Here's an example of what your requirements.txt file might look like for the AdvertiseX Data Engineering Case Study project:

```
pandas==1.3.3
geoip2==4.1.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.25
fastavro==1.4.4
```

## 7. Testing <a name="testing"></a>

Unit tests are provided in `test_process.py` to ensure the correctness of data processing logic. Run the tests using the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest test_process.py
```

## 8. Configuration <a name="configuration"></a>

Before running the project, make sure to configure the following settings:

### Sender and Receiver Emails for Alerts

The project uses Alertmanager to send email notifications for triggered alerts. You need to configure the sender email and receiver email in the `alertmanager.yml` file. Here's how to do it:

1. Open the `alertmanager.yml` file.
2. Find the `email_configs` section under the `receivers` section.
3. Set the `from` field to your sender email address.
4. Set the `to` field to the email address where you want to receive alerts.

### SMTP Server Settings

To enable email notifications, you need to configure the SMTP server settings in the `alertmanager.yml` file. Here's how to do it:

1. Open the `alertmanager.yml` file.
2. Find the `email_configs` section under the `receivers` section.
3. Set the `smarthost` field to your SMTP server address and port number. For example, `smtp.example.com:587`.
4. Set the `auth_username` field to your SMTP username.
5. Set the `auth_password` field to your SMTP password.

Make sure to replace placeholders like `${SMTP_SERVER}`, `${SMTP_PORT}`, `${SMTP_USERNAME}`, and `${SMTP_PASSWORD}` with the actual values provided by your SMTP service provider.

### Database URL

The project requires a PostgreSQL database to store processed data. Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to the URL of your PostgreSQL database. Here's how to do it:

```bash
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@hostname:port/database_name"
```

Replace `username`, `password`, `hostname`, `port`, and `database_name` with your PostgreSQL database credentials and connection details.
